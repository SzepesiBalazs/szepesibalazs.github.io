- Create a number that requires all the lines to be available (such as 8).
- Divide every line into 3 parts (Top, Mid, and Bottom).
- Ensure that any numbers can be placed next to each other and still display correctly.
- After all digits have been displayed, insert a line break.
- Create each number from 1 to 9 individually, starting with the number 8.

- Ensure that every number works at a larger scale by adjusting the parameters.
- The way of doing this, is that instead of creating 3 parts, I create 5 parts (Upper Top, Lower Top, Middle, Upper Bottom, Lower Bottom)
